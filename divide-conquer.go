/*

1. Binary Search:
Implement binary search to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.

2. Merge Sort:
Write a merge sort algorithm to sort an array or list of elements.

3. Closest Pair of Points:
Given an array of 2D points, find the two points with the smallest Euclidean distance between them.

4. Maximum Subarray Sum:
Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.

5. Matrix Multiplication:
Multiply two matrices using the Strassen's algorithm or other divide and conquer matrix multiplication methods.

6. Counting Inversions:
Given an array, count the number of inversions, where an inversion occurs if A[i] > A[j] and i < j.

7. Karatsuba Multiplication:
Implement integer multiplication using the Karatsuba algorithm, which reduces the number of subproblems.

8. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):
Implement the FFT algorithm to efficiently compute the discrete Fourier transform of a sequence.

9. Closest Pair in Strips:
Extend the closest pair problem to find the closest pair of points where one point lies in each of two disjoint vertical strips.

10. The Skyline Problem:
Given a list of building rectangles, find the skyline formed by these buildings when viewed from a distance.

11. Median of Two Sorted Arrays:
Find the median of two sorted arrays of equal size using a divide and conquer approach.

12. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
Find the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming and divide and conquer.

13. The Game of Nim:
Implement the game of Nim and develop a strategy for optimal moves using the divide and conquer approach.

14. Counting Triangles:
Given a set of points in a 2D plane, count the number of triangles that can be formed using these points as vertices.

15. Finding Majority Element:
Determine if there is a majority element (appearing more than n/2 times) in an array using divide and conquer.

16. Convex Hull:
Find the convex hull of a set of points in a 2D plane using algorithms like Graham's scan or Jarvis march
